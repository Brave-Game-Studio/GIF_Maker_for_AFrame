# GIF_Maker_for_AFrame
Configurable animated gif maker for A-Frame

The examplecode.html file isn't a complete A-Frame file, only code example of how to use the GIF

This library has been build using the following libraries and is really just a simplified interface with Aframe integration.
b64.js, GIFEncoder.js, LZWEncoder.js, NeuQuant.js

While this does have Aframe functionality via the screen shot library, you can use this GIF maker without Aframe, if you are only using it to read in files from a directory.
